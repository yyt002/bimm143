``` r
#or
#dim(countData)     and then countData[,2:7]
```

How many rows and cols in count data

``` r
dim(countData)
```

    ## [1] 19808     6

check that my metadata rows and coldata columns match

``` r
all(rownames(colData) == colnames(countData))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

Q. Complete the code below to filter countData to exclude genes (i.e. rows) where we have 0 read count across all samples (i.e. columns).

Tip: What will rowSums() of countData return and how could you use it in this context?

``` r
# Filter count data where you have 0 read count across all samples.
#head(countData)

countData = countData[rowSums(countData) != 0, ]
head(countData)
```

Q. Finally for this section let’s reorder these results by adjusted p-value and save them to a CSV file in your current project directory.

``` r
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res, file="deseq_results.csv")
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in res*e**n**t**r**e**z*)*a**n**d**w**e**h**a**v**e**t**h**e**f**o**l**d**c**h**a**n**g**e**r**e**s**u**l**t**s**f**r**o**m**D**E**S**e**q*2*a**n**a**l**y**s**i**s*(*s**t**o**r**e**d**i**n**r**e**s*log2FoldChange).

``` r

Now, let’s process our results a bit more to automagicaly pull out the top 5 upregulated pathways, then further process that just to get the pathway IDs needed by the pathview() function. We’ll use these KEGG pathway IDs for pathview plotting below.

``` r
## Focus on top 5 upregulated pathways here for demo purposes only
keggrespathways <- rownames(keggres$greater)[1:5]

# Extract the 8 character long IDs part of each string
keggresids = substr(keggrespathways, start=1, stop=8)
keggresids
```

    ## [1] "hsa04640" "hsa04630" "hsa00140" "hsa04142" "hsa04330"

Finally, lets pass these IDs in keggresids to the pathview() function to draw plots for all the top 5 pathways.

``` r
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id=keggresids, species="hsa")
```
